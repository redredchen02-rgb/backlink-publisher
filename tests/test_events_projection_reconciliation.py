"""Plan 005 / U5: reconciliation acceptance gate.

The origin's v1 success criterion: a known completed run's outcome counts
reconcile exactly against events.db totals — no silent undercount. Uses the
real checkpoint module (not synthetic `succeeded` fixtures) and reconciles
against the checkpoint source only (single-source per the failed-event dedup
decision). This test must fail on pre-fix `main` (successes dropped) and pass
after U1–U4.

Realism note: `skipped_unreachable` is written to the run's *output* rows, not
to the checkpoint (publish_backlinks.py), so it is intentionally not seeded as
a checkpoint item — the projector never sees it from the checkpoint, and the
dashboard must source it elsewhere.
