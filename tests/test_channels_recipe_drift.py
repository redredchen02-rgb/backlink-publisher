"""3-way drift guard for the browser-bind channel set (Plan 2026-05-27-008, U2).

`CHANNELS` (the low-level traversal-defense frozenset) must stay identical to
`set(RECIPES)` (the recipe registry) AND to the set of recipe *files on disk*.

`CHANNELS == set(RECIPES)` is already locked by
``tests/test_bind_channel_recipes.py::test_recipes_dict_covers_exactly_channels``.
The leg that was *unguarded* — and that this module adds — is the filesystem
one: dropping a ``recipes/<name>.py`` file without a ``RECIPES`` entry (or
leaving a stale entry after deleting the file) previously went undetected.

Why a guard and not derivation: ``CHANNELS`` cannot simply be
``frozenset(RECIPES)`` because ``channels/__init__`` is a lightweight primitive
imported by the bind driver, ``AuthExpiredError``, and CLI argparse, while a
recipe module (``medium.py``) imports the driver and config loader — deriving
would invert that layering and risk a ``channels -> recipes -> medium ->
driver -> channels`` import cycle. So the three representations stay separate
and this guard keeps them honest. Test-time only (never an import-time assert),
per ``invert-drift-check-when-invariant-becomes-dynamic``.
