# Lessons Kit Curation — Promote 6 MEMORY entries to docs/solutions/ with sanitization

## Overview

Convert 6 high-value private MEMORY feedback entries (`~/.claude/projects/.../memory/feedback_*.md`) into curated public `backlink-publisher/docs/solutions/<category>/*.md` entries that the global `learnings-researcher` Claude subagent can surface to PRs, contributors, and future agent sessions. Sanitize aggressively — no UUIDs, no real third-party domains, no absolute paths, no user-identifying quotes. Establish a quarterly dual-track promotion cadence in a new `backlink-publisher/AGENTS.md`. Bundle a one-pass outer-`docs/` drift cleanup since this work touches the docs tree anyway.

No code changes. Deliverables are 6 new markdown files + 1 AGENTS.md note + a per-file outer-docs audit applied as moves/deletes.

## Problem Frame

27 project-specific feedback memories exist only in private auto-memory at `~/.claude/projects/<project-memory-slug>/memory/` (the slug encodes the operator's filesystem layout and project codename — kept out of this committed plan; the implementer reads it from their own environment). They are invisible to `learnings-researcher`, `ce:review` personas, PR diffs, GitHub readers, and any new contributor. Some recur across sessions (e.g., `feedback_test-locks-in-bug` appeared 2× in one week). The project already has `docs/solutions/` with 5 entries and a working frontmatter convention written by `/ce:compound`. This plan promotes a curated 6 entries (7 source files; the two `save_config` memories collapse into one family entry) using that existing convention. (See origin: `backlink-publisher/docs/brainstorms/2026-05-15-lessons-kit-curation-requirements.md`.)

## Requirements Trace

- **R0** — Pre-flight smoke test against an existing `docs/solutions/` entry must pass before R1 begins; if it fails, this plan changes shape from "migrate files" to "fix agent". (origin §Pre-flight)
- **R1** — Promote 7 source entries → 6 destination files under `docs/solutions/{best-practices,logic-errors,test-failures}/`, mirroring same-category sibling schema. (origin §Migration R1)
- **R2 + R2.1 + R2.2 + R2.3** — Provenance lockdown (filename-only, no `~/.claude` paths), frontmatter regenerated from scratch (no `originSessionId`), operator identifiers neutralized (real domains → `example.com`; operator email → `<operator>@example.com`; the literal tokens live in the gitignored token file per Note A, not in this plan), 5-item pre-commit sanitization checklist completed in PR description. (origin §Migration R2.x)
- **R3** — `save_config` family merge into one logic-errors entry, cross-linked to existing test-failures sibling, scoped to write-path, OAuth/PR-date generalized away. (origin §R3)
- **R4 + R5** — Dual-track future capture documented in new `backlink-publisher/AGENTS.md` with quarterly cadence + sanitization rule + next review date 2026-08-15. (origin §Sustainability)
- **R6** — Outer `docs/` audit produces per-file move/keep/delete verdict; resulting moves applied. (origin §Cleanup)
- **R7** — No code in `src/`. No CLI. No hooks. (origin §Scope Constraints)
- **Success criteria** — All four `rg` grep gates return empty; sanitization checklist filled in PR; AGENTS.md ≤15 lines; private MEMORY files untouched. (origin §Success Criteria)

## Scope Boundaries

- **Out of scope**: any code change in `src/backlink_publisher/`, any new CLI subcommand (`bp lessons` or similar), any feedback-writer hook, any auto-promotion automation, any rewrite of the existing 5 `docs/solutions/` entries, any change to the global `learnings-researcher` agent itself, migration of the 20 MEMORY entries not on the curated list.
- **Explicitly out of scope** (workflow/git only): force-push hook entries, gh PR head-swap limitation, plan-duplicate-sub-blocks, ce:review-finds-latent-bugs, measurement-gated-merge, brainstorm-prompt-as-desired-state, hypothesis-dev-dep-ci-trap, plan-vs-code-drift.

## Context & Research

### Relevant Code and Patterns

All 5 existing entries (not just the 3 sibling-schema references):

- `backlink-publisher/docs/solutions/test-failures/inverted-negative-assertion-enshrined-config-save-data-loss-2026-05-14.md` — schema reference for `test-failures/` entries; uses `symptoms[]`, `root_cause`, `resolution_type`, `related_components[]`. Also the existing test-side counterpart of the `save_config` family — R3 must cross-link here, not restate.
- `backlink-publisher/docs/solutions/test-failures/ci-test-isolation-failures-medium-brave-sleep-timeout-2026-05-13.md` — second `test-failures/` reference; cross-check against this when shaping the new `negative-assertion-locks-in-bug` entry.
- `backlink-publisher/docs/solutions/logic-errors/language-matches-always-true-no-op-gate-2026-05-14.md` — schema reference for `logic-errors/` entries; same expanded shape.
- `backlink-publisher/docs/solutions/best-practices/document-review-catches-runtime-errors-at-plan-time-2026-05-14.md` — schema reference for `best-practices/` entries; uses `applies_when[]`. **NOTE**: this entry uses path-style `category: docs/solutions/best-practices`, conflicting with the slug-only decision below — see precedence rule in Unit 2.
- `backlink-publisher/docs/solutions/ui-bugs/webui-blocking-subprocess-and-missing-progress-feedback-2026-05-12.md` — `ui-bugs/` category exists with one entry; not migrated to here, but worth knowing exists.
- Existing `category:` style is **slug-only** in 3 of 5 files (path-style in 2). Locked decision: use slug-only across the new 6.
- Provenance precedent already set: `feedback_test-locks-in-bug.md (auto memory [claude])` — used inline in `inverted-negative-assertion-...md`. Match this exactly.

### Institutional Learnings

- `learnings-researcher` search: no prior solution entries cover documentation migration, schema curation, or sanitization. We are writing the first meta-process entries of this kind for this repo. No existing pattern to imitate beyond the structural frontmatter shape.

### Repo Topology Findings (from repo-research-analyst)

- `learnings-researcher` is a global Claude Code subagent, not repo-configured — no project-level wiring required. The agent's path-scanning behavior is its own implementation. R0 pre-flight therefore tests the agent's matching behavior against an entry that already exists.
- No `AGENTS.md` exists anywhere in the project tree — greenfield decision. R5 lands at `backlink-publisher/AGENTS.md` (matches existing convention that all project docs live under `backlink-publisher/`).
- ADV-3 alternative ("teach agent to read MEMORY directly") is not feasible at the project level — the agent is global plugin code, not project-configurable. Recording the investigation result so the path-dependency to `docs/solutions/` becomes a deliberate choice.
- Outer `docs/` contains exactly 7 files (1 setup doc + 3 plans + 2 brainstorms + 1 ideation). All require per-file verdict (see Unit 3).

## Key Technical Decisions

- **Frontmatter is regenerated, not copy-pasted** — Eliminates `originSessionId`, `node_type`, and `name` fields from auto-memory format. Security `SEC-002` correctly classified this as a hard requirement, not a nice-to-have.
- **Slug-only `category:` style** — Dominant 3:2 in existing entries; locking it for the new 6 prevents entrenching the drift further. Existing 2 path-style entries left untouched (out of scope per origin §Scope Boundaries).
- **Quarterly cadence as the explicit forcing function, not a hook** — The honest fix for "manual promotion fails" is a calendar item written into AGENTS.md, not a /ship-time prompt. Acknowledging the periodic-sprint cost is more sustainable than pretending automation will solve it. Next review: 2026-08-15. (See origin Key Decision: quarterly cadence.)
- **Pre-flight blocks migration (R0)** — If `learnings-researcher` doesn't surface an existing entry, the plan's whole premise breaks. 30 minutes spent here saves 6 files of wasted work + a misleading AGENTS.md note. Fail-fast.
- **Bundle outer-docs cleanup in this plan** — The drift exists; touching `docs/` anyway means marginal cost is small. Bundling avoids creating a separate plan that probably never gets written.
- **Single AGENTS.md location at `backlink-publisher/AGENTS.md`** — All existing project docs live under that path. Outer-root AGENTS.md would itself be drift.

## Open Questions

### Resolved During Planning

- **Q1 (origin Deferred)**: Is the agent path hardcoded? — **Yes**, agent is global plugin code; project cannot reconfigure it. ADV-3 alternative not pursued; documented in Unit 1 verification.
- **Q2 (origin Deferred R1)**: Which `category:` style to use? — **Slug-only** (research found dominant 3:2; existing 2 path-style entries remain unchanged).
- **Q3 (origin Deferred R5)**: Where does AGENTS.md live? — **`backlink-publisher/AGENTS.md`** (greenfield; matches convention that all project docs live under `backlink-publisher/`).

### Deferred to Implementation

- **Per-file outer-docs audit verdicts**: For each outer file with a number-collision against an inner plan (2026-05-13-001, 2026-05-13-002), the implementer must read both files and decide MOVE-with-renumber vs DELETE based on whether the topics are genuinely distinct. Unit 3 prescribes the audit method; verdicts are recorded during execution.
- **Exact MEMORY first-encounter dates**: For the Provenance line, the implementer must read each source `feedback_*.md` to extract the first-encountered date. Not pre-resolved here because the dates may differ from the source file mtime if the entry was edited.
- **Sanitization edge cases inside lesson bodies**: For each of the 6 entries, the implementer must scan the source body for additional operator-private content beyond the tokens enumerated in `~/.local/share/backlink-publisher/private-tokens.txt` (real target domains, the operator's email, run IDs, internal hostnames, etc.). The R2.3 5-item checklist + Unit 5's PII regex defense-in-depth gate are the safety net; what specifically gets neutralized is execution-time discovery.

---

- [ ] **Unit 1: Pre-flight — validate `learnings-researcher` surfaces an existing solutions entry**

**Goal:** Prove the migration premise before writing any new files. If the agent doesn't surface entries from `backlink-publisher/docs/solutions/`, this plan changes shape — abort and reframe.

**Requirements:** R0

**Dependencies:** None — this gates all other units.

**Files:**
- Read-only: `backlink-publisher/docs/solutions/test-failures/inverted-negative-assertion-enshrined-config-save-data-loss-2026-05-14.md`
- Output: brief result note (verbatim agent response excerpt) appended under "## Pre-flight Result" in this plan file

**Approach:**
- **Pre-pre-flight: harness check.** Before invoking `learnings-researcher`, verify the agent is reachable in the current harness. Quick test: dispatch with a trivial query and inspect the response. If the response is "no such subagent" / "tool not found" / similar, the implementer is NOT in a Claude Code session with the compound-engineering plugin loaded. In that case: either (a) switch to Claude Code with the plugin enabled and retry, or (b) skip Unit 1 entirely and explicitly mark the migration premise as "taken on faith" in this plan's Pre-flight Result note. Do NOT misdiagnose a harness mismatch as "agent doesn't surface entry" — the failure modes are different.
- Dispatch `compound-engineering:research:learnings-researcher` with a query targeting the existing `inverted-negative-assertion-...` entry's domain (e.g., "negative test assertion masking config-save data loss"). The entry has high specificity, so a positive hit is meaningful.
- Inspect the response: does it return the file path? Does it quote frontmatter? Which fields drove the match (likely `tags[]`, `symptoms[]`, or `applies_when[]`)?
- Decision tree:
  - Agent surfaces the entry → premise validated; proceed to Unit 2.
  - Agent does not surface OR returns wrong file → STOP. Open a new requirements doc to scope "fix the agent" before considering migration. Update this plan's status to `blocked`.

**Patterns to follow:**
- The `learnings-researcher` agent invocation pattern already used during this brainstorm session (Phase 1 of `ce:plan` confirmed it scans `docs/solutions/` from the working directory).

**Test scenarios:**
- Happy path: agent invocation with query matching `inverted-negative-assertion-...` topic returns the entry's path and at least one matching field reference.
- Edge case: agent returns a different but related entry (e.g., the `language-matches-always-true-...` entry instead). Verify the matching mechanism still works for our intended new entries by inspecting which fields drove the partial match.
- Failure path: agent returns "no matches" or empty results → record the response verbatim, escalate per Decision tree above.

**Verification:**
- A single-line note added to this plan file under "## Pre-flight Result" stating: pass/fail, the matched file, and which frontmatter fields appeared to drive the match. This unblocks Unit 2.

---

- [ ] **Unit 1.5: Bootstrap `private-tokens.txt` and capture MEMORY baselines**

**Goal:** Make the gates in Units 2 & 5 actually executable by creating the load-bearing inputs they assume exist.

**Requirements:** Prerequisite for R2.2 / R2.3 / Unit 5 grep gates; prerequisite for "MEMORY untouched" verification.

**Dependencies:** Unit 1 (pre-flight passed)

**Files (create):**
- `~/.local/share/backlink-publisher/private-tokens.txt` (gitignored by default — outside any repo; one regex per line)
- `~/.local/share/backlink-publisher/memory-baseline-2026-05-15.txt` (sha256 sums of the 7 source MEMORY files)

**Approach:**
- Create `~/.local/share/backlink-publisher/` if absent: `mkdir -p ~/.local/share/backlink-publisher`.
- Populate `private-tokens.txt` by reading the 7 source `feedback_*.md` files (paths from §Sources) and extracting the literal operator-private tokens that appear in their bodies. Categories of tokens to enumerate: real target domains, the operator's email address, real run IDs, real config-key hostnames. **One regex per line, fixed-string preferred.** Do not paste the literal tokens into any committed file or chat message during this step — write directly to disk.
- Generate the MEMORY baseline: `find ~/.claude/projects/<project-memory-slug>/memory -name 'feedback_*.md' -type f | sort | xargs shasum -a 256 > ~/.local/share/backlink-publisher/memory-baseline-2026-05-15.txt`. Captures pre-execution sha256 for Unit 5's "untouched" verification.
- Verify both files are non-empty and outside any git repo: `git check-ignore -v ~/.local/share/backlink-publisher/private-tokens.txt` should return nothing (path is outside any repo, not gitignored — it's just unreachable to git from `backlink-publisher/`).

**Patterns to follow:**
- Token extraction is human-in-the-loop; no automation.

**Test scenarios:**
- Happy path: both files exist, non-empty, outside repo. `wc -l ~/.local/share/backlink-publisher/private-tokens.txt` ≥ 3 (at least domain + email + run-id pattern).
- Edge case: implementer's `~/.local/share/` doesn't exist → `mkdir -p` creates it.
- Failure path: implementer accidentally created `private-tokens.txt` in the repo root → DELETE immediately, recreate at the correct path; if any commit captured it, scrub history before continuing.

**Verification:**
- Both files exist at `~/.local/share/backlink-publisher/`.
- `private-tokens.txt` has at least 3 patterns; `git ls-files | grep private-tokens` (from inside `backlink-publisher/`) returns nothing.
- MEMORY baseline file has 7 lines (one per source `feedback_*.md`).

---

- [ ] **Unit 2: Migrate 6 lesson entries with full sanitization**

**Goal:** Write the 6 destination files under `backlink-publisher/docs/solutions/{best-practices,logic-errors,test-failures}/` in their proper sub-categories, with regenerated frontmatter and neutralized bodies.

**Requirements:** R1, R2, R2.1, R2.2, R2.3, R3

**Dependencies:** Units 1 and 1.5

**Operator hygiene (read once, applies throughout):**
- Read source MEMORY only via the Read tool — never `cat | tee`, `less`, or any command that scrolls into terminal scrollback that may sync.
- The user's global `Stop` hook syncs to Obsidian (per global CLAUDE.md). Do NOT paste source MEMORY content into chat messages during the session — the journal sync may capture it. If you need to discuss a source body, paraphrase or reference by line.
- Editor swap files (`.swp`, `*~`) for the destination markdown files: ensure your editor is configured to write swap files inside the repo (where they're gitignored) or to a private temp dir; not to a synced/shared location.

**Files (create):**
- `backlink-publisher/docs/solutions/logic-errors/save-config-write-paths-bypass-preservation-2026-05-15.md` — combined `feedback_config-save-overwrite-pattern` + `feedback_narrow-toml-merge-bypasses-save_config` (R3 family entry)
- `backlink-publisher/docs/solutions/best-practices/no-runtime-llm-2026-05-15.md` — `feedback_no-runtime-llm`
- `backlink-publisher/docs/solutions/best-practices/standalone-page-vs-retrofit-webui-2026-05-15.md` — `feedback_standalone-page-vs-retrofit`
- `backlink-publisher/docs/solutions/test-failures/negative-assertion-locks-in-bug-2026-05-15.md` — `feedback_test-locks-in-bug` (note: this is the *general pattern* entry; the existing `inverted-negative-assertion-...` is the *specific incident*; cross-link bidirectionally)
- `backlink-publisher/docs/solutions/logic-errors/floating-point-tiebreak-anchor-scheduler-2026-05-15.md` — `feedback_floating-point-tiebreak`
- `backlink-publisher/docs/solutions/best-practices/recon-log-level-for-always-on-signals-2026-05-15.md` — `feedback_recon-level-for-always-on-signals`
- `backlink-publisher/docs/solutions/best-practices/plan-time-url-validation-prevents-publish-404-2026-05-15.md` — `feedback_plan-time-url-hallucination`

**Files (edit — for bidirectional cross-link):**
- `backlink-publisher/docs/solutions/test-failures/inverted-negative-assertion-enshrined-config-save-data-loss-2026-05-14.md` — add a "See also" line referencing the new `negative-assertion-locks-in-bug-2026-05-15.md` general-pattern entry. This makes the cross-link bidirectional (new → old AND old → new). One-line edit; no other changes to this existing file.

**Files (read-only sources):**
- `~/.claude/projects/<project-memory-slug>/memory/feedback_*.md` (the 7 source files; the implementer resolves `<project-memory-slug>` from their own environment — the literal slug encodes the operator's filesystem layout and project codename and is kept out of this committed plan)
- All 5 existing `docs/solutions/*/*.md` for sibling-schema reference

**Approach:**
- **Precedence rule (read first):** Where this plan's locked decisions in §Key Technical Decisions conflict with sibling-schema mirroring, the locked decisions win on a per-field basis. Specifically: `category:` is **always slug-only** for the new 6 entries, even though the best-practices sibling (`document-review-catches-...md`) uses path-style `category: docs/solutions/best-practices`. Sibling schema dictates field *set* and *shape*, not literal `category` value. **Schema extension (deliberate)**: new entries MAY add `applies_when:` even when the same-category sibling lacks it — `applies_when[]` is a documented driver field for `learnings-researcher` agent matching (verified in Unit 5 smoke tests). Adding it to entries where it improves discoverability is intentional schema extension, not drift; existing siblings remain unchanged per scope boundary.
- For each destination file:
  1. Read the source `feedback_*.md` body via Read tool. Note frontmatter fields (will be discarded per R2.1).
  2. Open the same-category sibling schema reference (Context & Research §Relevant Code).
  3. Write fresh frontmatter from sibling schema only — no field passthrough from source. Use `category:` slug-only style (override sibling if the sibling is path-style; precedence rule above). Set `date: 2026-05-15`.
  4. Write Context section: when/where the bug bit. Strip operator identifiers per R2.2 mapping table (real target domains → `example.com`; operator email → `<operator>@example.com`; specific timestamped run IDs of the form `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS-<hash>` → `<run-id>`; real config keys containing customer/target hostnames → `[sites."<target-host>".url_categories]`). The exact tokens to scrub live in `~/.local/share/backlink-publisher/private-tokens.txt` (per Note A) — read from there, not from this plan.
  5. Write Guidance section: the rule, with code/path examples that reference real project modules but neutral data (e.g., `config.py:save_config` is fine; `config.py:save_config dropped sites."<target-host>".url_categories` is fine; the same sentence with the operator's real target host is NOT — that fails the Unit 5 grep gate).
  6. Write Provenance line at end: `Provenance: feedback_<slug>.md (auto memory [claude], first encountered <YYYY-MM-DD>)`. Read source for the date.
  7. For the R3 family entry only: include both incidents as numbered scenarios within one document; cross-link to `docs/solutions/test-failures/inverted-negative-assertion-...md`; generalize the OAuth-refresh trigger to "partial serializers silently drop unmanaged config sections"; drop the "PR #12 / 2026-05-14" specifics.
  8. For the test-failures `negative-assertion-locks-in-bug` entry: cross-link to existing `inverted-negative-assertion-...md` so readers find both the general pattern and the specific incident.
- After writing each file, run the 5-item sanitization checklist (R2.3) and tick each box mentally; the formal sign-off happens in Unit 5.

**Patterns to follow:**
- Schema mirrors per category (Context & Research §Relevant Code).
- Provenance precedent format: `feedback_X.md (auto memory [claude], first encountered YYYY-MM-DD)`.
- Cross-link style: bare relative path inline, e.g., "See `docs/solutions/test-failures/inverted-negative-assertion-...md` for the test-side counterpart."

**Test scenarios:**
- Happy path: each of the 6 destination files exists with frontmatter matching its same-category sibling's field set.
- Sanitization (Edge): `rg -n '\.claude/projects' backlink-publisher/docs/solutions/` returns no hits in the 6 new files.
- Sanitization (Edge): `rg -n 'originSessionId|node_type: memory|^name: feedback_' backlink-publisher/docs/solutions/` returns no hits.
- Sanitization (Edge): `rg -nF -f .gitignore-of-private-tokens backlink-publisher/docs/solutions/` *(see Note A below for the private-token list — do NOT inline the literal email/domain in this plan or any committed doc; the list itself lives at `~/.local/share/backlink-publisher/private-tokens.txt`, not in the repo)* returns no hits.
- Family-merge (Edge): the new `save-config-write-paths-bypass-preservation-...` entry contains both `config-save-overwrite` and `narrow-toml-merge` scenarios in one document, cross-links to `inverted-negative-assertion-...md`, and does NOT contain "PR #12" or "2026-05-14" as fix-window markers.
- Cross-link (Integration): the new `negative-assertion-locks-in-bug-...` entry references `inverted-negative-assertion-...md`, and a future read of `inverted-negative-assertion-...md` should ideally be updated to back-reference the new pattern entry — note as a small follow-up edit.
- Error path: any source `feedback_*.md` is missing or unreadable → halt that file's migration, record which one failed, do not partial-write.

**Verification:**
- 6 new files exist at the listed paths.
- All 4 grep gates above return empty.
- The R3 family entry mentions both source patterns and cross-links the test-failures sibling.

- [ ] **Unit 3: Outer `docs/` drift audit and applied moves**

**Goal:** Eliminate the parallel `docs/` tree at the project root by producing a per-file verdict and applying it.

**Requirements:** R6

**Dependencies:** Unit 1 (pre-flight passed). Can run in parallel with Unit 2.

**Files (audit input — outer `docs/`):**

| Outer file | Inner equivalent? | Initial verdict | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `docs/MEDIUM_OAUTH_SETUP.md` | None — inner has no `MEDIUM_OAUTH_SETUP.md` | MOVE | `mv ../docs/MEDIUM_OAUTH_SETUP.md docs/MEDIUM_OAUTH_SETUP.md && git add docs/MEDIUM_OAUTH_SETUP.md` (from inside `backlink-publisher/`) |
| `docs/plans/2026-05-12-001-feat-draft-queue-scheduled-publish-plan.md` | Inner has 002, 003, 004, 007 for 2026-05-12 — no 001 | MOVE | `mv` to inner + `git add`; preserve `001` numbering (slot is empty inside) |
| `docs/plans/2026-05-13-001-feat-anchor-profile-scheduler-plan.md` | Inner has `2026-05-13-001-feat-anchor-text-followups-plan.md` (same number, different topic) | DECIDE AT EXECUTION | Read both. If outer is a predecessor of the inner anchor-text family → `rm ../docs/plans/...`. If genuinely distinct topic → `mv` with renumber to next available 2026-05-13 slot + `git add`. |
| `docs/plans/2026-05-13-002-feat-zh-short-article-scheduler-plan.md` | Inner has `2026-05-13-002-feat-oauth-preflight-token-refresh-plan.md` (same number, different topic) | DECIDE AT EXECUTION | Same method as above; almost certainly MOVE with renumber. |
| `docs/brainstorms/2026-05-13-anchor-profile-scheduler-requirements.md` | Inner has no exact match (closest: `2026-05-13-checkpoint-resume-requirements.md`) | DECIDE AT EXECUTION | Verdict depends on the matching plan file's verdict above (process plan first). If outer plan was DELETED → also DELETE this. If outer plan was MOVED → MOVE this alongside. |
| `docs/brainstorms/2026-05-13-work-themed-backlinks-requirements.md` | Inner has plan `2026-05-13-004-feat-work-themed-backlinks-plan.md` but no requirements with that name | MOVE | `mv` + `git add` |
| `docs/ideation/2026-05-15-open-ideation.md` | Inner ideation/ has 3 entries; this isn't one | MOVE | `mv` + `git add`; this is the file written during this brainstorm session |

**Approach:**
- **Cross-repo reality**: the outer `docs/` tree is OUTSIDE the inner git repo (only `.git` lives at `backlink-publisher/.git`). `git mv outer/path inner/path` is impossible — git refuses cross-repo moves. Use plain shell:
  - For files marked `MOVE`: `mv ../docs/path backlink-publisher/docs/path && (cd backlink-publisher && git add docs/path)`. The outer file simply disappears (it has no git history to preserve; outer `docs/` was never tracked).
  - For files marked `DELETE`: `rm ../docs/path` directly.
  - All commands run from inside `backlink-publisher/` (the only repo); use `../docs/` to reach the outer tree.
- **Audit ordering**: process the 2026-05-13-001 plan-file collision FIRST. Its verdict propagates to the 2026-05-13-anchor-profile-scheduler-requirements.md row (if outer plan was DELETED as predecessor, also DELETE the matching outer requirements; if outer plan was MOVE-with-renumber, MOVE the requirements alongside).
- For files marked `DECIDE AT EXECUTION`: `diff ../docs/path backlink-publisher/docs/path-of-similar-content`; if outer is older predecessor with content fully superseded inside → DELETE outer; otherwise MOVE with renumber to next free slot for the date.
- **30-minute timebox per file**: if any single DECIDE-AT-EXECUTION file's audit (read both sides + diff + form a verdict) is not done in 30 minutes — STOP. Mark that file as "deferred to follow-up plan", leave it in place, do not block Units 4/5 on it. The lessons-migration value of Units 2/4/5 must not get held hostage by an outer-docs surprise. Open a separate brainstorm/plan for the deferred files later; track in this plan's "## Outer-Docs Audit Result" with status `DEFERRED-30MIN-TIMEBOX`.
- Update this plan with the per-file final verdicts under "## Outer-Docs Audit Result" once execution completes (including any DEFERRED rows).

**Patterns to follow:**
- Existing inner-docs filename convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-<type>-<descriptive-name>-{plan,requirements,ideation}.md`.

**Test scenarios:**
- Happy path: outer `docs/` after this unit contains zero `*.md` files (or contains only files whose verdict was explicitly KEEP — none anticipated).
- Edge case: a number collision is resolved by reading both files and verifying their content is genuinely different before renumbering, preventing accidental data loss.
- Error path: a `git mv` fails (target exists, dirty state) → halt, record state, do not force.

**Verification:**
- `find docs/ -name '*.md' -type f` (from project root, NOT `backlink-publisher/`) returns empty (or only KEEP-verdicted files).
- All moved files are accessible at their new inner paths.
- Per-file final verdict table is appended to this plan as "## Outer-Docs Audit Result".

- [ ] **Unit 4: AGENTS.md dual-track convention note**

**Goal:** Create `backlink-publisher/AGENTS.md` documenting the lesson promotion path so future contributors and agents know how new lessons reach `docs/solutions/`.

**Requirements:** R5

**Dependencies:** Unit 1 (pre-flight). Can run in parallel with Units 2 and 3.

**Files:**
- Create: `backlink-publisher/AGENTS.md`

**Approach:**
- File is greenfield. Initial content is the dual-track lessons note only — DO NOT preemptively populate other agent guidance (that's separate scope).
- Length goal: as short as possible while a contributor with **zero prior context** (doesn't know what `/ce:compound` is, hasn't seen the brainstorm, doesn't know auto-memory exists) can act on it. The earlier ≤15 cap was vanity; transmission quality wins.
- **Cadence framing**: the "next review 2026-08-15" line is an **aspiration, not a forcing function**. AGENTS.md is not read by CI, not surfaced by any tool. The honest mechanism that triggers the next promotion pass is: the next time `/ce:compound` or `/ce:plan` runs in this repo, the user has the opportunity (not obligation) to scan recent `feedback_*` and decide whether anything warrants promotion. State this honestly so future contributors don't mistake a date in static markdown for an enforced gate.
  1. Title: `# AGENTS.md — backlink-publisher`
  2. Pointer: "See `README.md` for project overview and `docs/` for plans/brainstorms/solutions."
  3. Subsection: `## Lessons capture (dual-track)`
  4. Body content:
     - The path: Claude auto-memory writes private `feedback_*.md` (a Claude Code auto-memory feature; see global CLAUDE.md hooks for details); high-value/recurring lessons are promoted manually via `/ce:compound` (a Claude Code skill from the `compound-engineering` plugin — see plugin docs) into `docs/solutions/<category>/`.
     - The sanitization rule (verbatim from origin R5): *"Promotion is rewriting, not copy-paste. Strip session UUIDs, real domains, absolute paths, and user-identifying quotes; teach the pattern, not the incident."*
     - Next curation review: **2026-08-15** — *aspirational quarterly cadence; not enforced by any tool.* This file is not read by CI; the actual trigger is "next time `/ce:compound` or `/ce:plan` runs, scan recent `feedback_*` and decide". Update this date when the review completes; treat skipping a quarter as a soft signal, not a failure.

**Patterns to follow:**
- No existing `AGENTS.md` in the project, so no shape to mirror. Keep it minimal; future agent guidance can extend it.

**Test scenarios:**
- Happy path: `backlink-publisher/AGENTS.md` exists, contains the three required elements (dual-track path, sanitization line, next review date 2026-08-15) + a one-line definition of `/ce:compound` so a zero-context reader can act.
- Future-proofing (Integration): a contributor reading this file should know within 30 seconds (a) where lessons live, (b) when to promote, (c) what to strip when promoting, (d) what `/ce:compound` is and where to learn more.

**Verification:**
- File exists, contains the literal sanitization sentence, contains "2026-08-15", contains a `/ce:compound` pointer (e.g., "Claude Code skill — see `compound-engineering` plugin").

---

- [ ] **Unit 5: Final verification — grep gates + sanitization checklist + post-migration smoke**

**Goal:** Confirm all success criteria from the requirements doc pass before the plan is marked complete and a PR is opened.

**Requirements:** All success criteria from origin

**Dependencies:** Units 2, 3, 4 all complete

**Files:**
- Read-only: all 6 new entries in `docs/solutions/`, the new `AGENTS.md`, the cleaned outer `docs/`
- Output: 5-item sanitization checklist filled per-file in the eventual PR description (record locally first as a markdown table)

**Approach:**
- Run all 4 grep gates from origin Success Criteria; capture output.
- **Defense-in-depth PII regex gate** (catches unknown-unknowns not in `private-tokens.txt`):
  ```
  rg -nE '[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}|sk_(live|test)_[A-Za-z0-9]+|eyJ[A-Za-z0-9_-]+\.|[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}' backlink-publisher/docs/solutions/
  ```
  Catches any email, Stripe key, JWT prefix, or IPv4. Must return empty.
- For each of the 6 new entries, fill the R2.3 5-item checklist (now 6-item with PII regex) in a markdown table:

  | File | (1) no abs paths | (2) no UUIDs | (3) no token-list hits | (4) no user quotes | (5) no fix-window dates | (6) PII regex empty |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

- **MEMORY untouched verification (sha256 baseline approach, not mtime)**: regenerate sha256 sums for the 7 source files post-execution and `diff` against the baseline captured in Unit 1.5. The mtime approach is fragile because Claude's auto-memory may rewrite files at session-end via Stop hook for unrelated reasons; sha256 gives content-equivalence.
  ```
  find ~/.claude/projects/<project-memory-slug>/memory -name 'feedback_*.md' -type f | sort | xargs shasum -a 256 | diff - ~/.local/share/backlink-publisher/memory-baseline-2026-05-15.txt
  ```
  Must produce no diff.
- Smoke-test post-migration: dispatch `learnings-researcher` against ALL 6 trigger topics (one per new entry), not just one. Per the brainstorm's ADV-1 finding, single-entry smoke is insufficient; full coverage is cheap.
- **"Surfaces" rubric** (concrete pass/fail criteria, replacing the prior soft signal): an entry "surfaces" iff it appears in the agent's top-3 results AND the queried trigger topic matches at least one field in `tags[]`, `symptoms[]`, or `applies_when[]`. Returning a sibling-but-not-the-queried entry counts as a partial signal but NOT a pass — re-tag the entry to make the match explicit.
- If any smoke test fails: investigate which frontmatter field gap caused the miss; fix in place (re-tag, re-categorize) without re-litigating the entire entry; re-run smoke on the affected entry only.

**Patterns to follow:**
- `rg` patterns from origin Success Criteria literal-text.

**Test scenarios:**
- All 4 grep gates return empty: `rg -n '\.claude/projects' backlink-publisher/docs/solutions/`, `rg -n 'originSessionId|node_type: memory' backlink-publisher/docs/solutions/`, `rg -nF -f ~/.local/share/backlink-publisher/private-tokens.txt backlink-publisher/docs/solutions/`, plus the PII regex gate above.
- 6-item sanitization table is fully populated with ✓ for each of 6 files × 6 items = 36 cells.
- 6/6 smoke tests pass per the rubric above (top-3 + field match).
- Edge case: smoke test for the cross-linked R3 family entry surfaces both the new logic-errors entry AND the existing test-failures entry (validating the cross-link works for the agent).
- Edge case: PII regex gate catches a domain or email that wasn't in `private-tokens.txt` → add the pattern to the token file, re-scrub the affected entry, re-run gates.
- Failure path: any cell in the sanitization table is ✗ → fix the entry before this unit completes, do not advance to PR with red cells.

**Verification:**
- All 4 grep gates: empty.
- Sanitization table: 36 ✓.
- Smoke tests: 6/6 pass per rubric.
- Source MEMORY content unchanged: sha256 baseline diff produces zero output.

## System-Wide Impact

- **Interaction graph**: `learnings-researcher` agent will start surfacing the 6 new entries to any future ce:review / ce:plan / ce:work session. PRs that touch related areas (config save, anchor scheduler, webui retrofitting, etc.) will get these lessons cited automatically. ce:review personas (especially `kieran-python-reviewer`, `correctness-reviewer`, `testing-reviewer`) gain a new institutional memory pool.
- **Error propagation**: None — pure docs work, no runtime change.
- **State lifecycle risks**: The outer-docs `git mv` operations could collide if any uncommitted changes exist there at execution time. Unit 3 verifies clean state pre-move.
- **API surface parity**: The 5 existing solutions entries continue to work as-is. The two existing path-style `category:` entries are not touched — they remain mixed-style with the new slug-only 6. (Decision: do not touch existing entries; out of scope per origin.)
- **Integration coverage**: Unit 5 explicitly tests 6/6 smoke tests against the agent — this catches frontmatter-routing bugs that mocks alone wouldn't.
- **Unchanged invariants**: Private MEMORY (`~/.claude/projects/.../memory/feedback_*.md`) remains authoritative for itself; promotion is additive only. The 20 not-promoted entries continue to live there. The global `learnings-researcher` agent itself is not modified.

## Risks & Dependencies

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Pre-flight (Unit 1) reveals agent doesn't index this path → 6 files of work wasted | R0 gates everything; abort and reframe before any new file is written. Cost: 30 minutes vs days. |
| Sanitization gap leaks operator identifier to git history (e.g., a less-obvious domain in entry body) | R2.3 5-item checklist + 4 grep gates. The grep gates catch the obvious cases; checklist forces human eyes for the subtler ones. |
| `git mv` collision in outer-docs cleanup (target file exists in inner) | Per-file table in Unit 3 pre-identifies collisions; DECIDE-AT-EXECUTION resolves them with diff before mv. |
| Quarterly cadence (R5) is forgotten — back to backlog | Date is written into the AGENTS.md file as **2026-08-15**, not a calendar tool. Forcing function is the file itself; review must update the date when complete. |
| Future contributors copy-paste from MEMORY without sanitizing | R5 includes the verbatim sanitization rule directly in AGENTS.md. Every future ce:compound user reads this. |
| Plan / requirements docs themselves leak the literal grep tokens (the same anti-pattern this plan exists to prevent) — happened TWICE during this plan's own document-review cycle | Switched to `rg -F -f ~/.local/share/backlink-publisher/private-tokens.txt` (Note A). Tokens live only on local disk; committed docs reference the methodology, not the values. **Recurrence-2x is itself a lesson worth promoting in the next quarterly cadence**: "the act of writing about sanitization tends to leak the things being sanitized; require a final `rg -niE -f ~/.local/share/backlink-publisher/private-tokens.txt` pass against ANY committed doc — plan, brainstorm, or solution — before merging." |
| Frontmatter field choices route an entry to the wrong agent match | Unit 5 smoke-tests all 6, not 1 (per ADV-1 fix). A wrong-routing entry gets caught and re-tagged. |

## Documentation / Operational Notes

- The single PR for this plan will include: 6 new solutions files, 1 new AGENTS.md, 1-7 outer-docs file moves/deletes, the filled sanitization checklist (in PR description per R2.3).
- PR description must explicitly list each of the 6 files against the 5-item sanitization checklist (30-cell table) — this is a concrete artifact of R2.3's reviewer sign-off requirement.
- No CI changes. No test runner changes. No `pyproject.toml` changes.
- Force-push hooks (per MEMORY entries we are NOT promoting) remain active; this plan respects them.

## Note A — Private-Token Grep Pattern

The token file lives at **`~/.local/share/backlink-publisher/private-tokens.txt`** — one regex per line, fixed-string preferred. The path is outside any repo (no gitignore needed; git can't reach it from `backlink-publisher/`). Bootstrap is Unit 1.5; the file enumerates the operator's real target domains, email, run-ID patterns, and any other operator-private tokens that appear in the 7 source MEMORY entries.

The success-criteria grep gate (R2.2) uses:
```
rg -nF -f ~/.local/share/backlink-publisher/private-tokens.txt backlink-publisher/docs/solutions/
```
Must return empty. The tokens stay on disk; only the methodology lives in this committed plan.

**Defense-in-depth**: Unit 5 adds a generic PII regex gate (emails, JWTs, Stripe keys, IPv4 addresses) that catches unknown-unknown leaks not enumerated in the token file.

**Bootstrap protocol** (lives in Unit 1.5, not here): the file is created and populated by the implementer reading the 7 source files via the Read tool. Without this bootstrap, Unit 5 grep gate vacuously passes against an empty pattern file — Unit 1.5 verifies the file is non-empty (≥3 patterns) before Unit 5 runs.

**Multi-operator caveat**: this is a single-operator workflow. If the project ever has a second contributor doing curation, the bootstrap protocol must be re-run on their machine — the token file is per-operator, not shared. The 2026-08-15 quarterly reviewer must verify the file exists and is current before running gates.

## Unit 5 Verification Result (executed 2026-05-15)

All 4 grep gates: empty (`exit=1` from rg, meaning no matches). sha256 baseline diff produced zero output — source MEMORY files truly untouched.

7/7 smoke tests PASS (one batched `learnings-researcher` dispatch covering all 7 destination files):

| # | Query | Expected file (basename) | Rank | Driver fields | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | save_config TOML preservation data loss unmanaged | save-config-write-paths-bypass-preservation-2026-05-15.md | 1/12 | tags + symptoms + applies_when | PASS |

| Q7 | plan-time URL synthesis verification publish 404 | plan-time-url-validation-prevents-publish-404-2026-05-15.md | 1/12 | tags + applies_when | PASS |

Strong rank-1 margins (scores 16–26 vs runner-ups ≤10). Cross-link validation: Q1 surfaces both the new family entry AND the existing `inverted-negative-assertion-...` test-failures sibling — confirming the bidirectional cross-link works at the agent level. Q4 similarly surfaces both general-pattern + specific-incident.

Sanitization checklist (R2.3 6-item × 7 destination files = 42 cells):

| File | (1) no abs paths | (2) no UUIDs | (3) no token-list hits | (4) no user quotes | (5) no fix-window dates | (6) PII regex empty |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| best-practices/no-runtime-llm | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

¹ Item 5 note: contains one "PR #12 (save_config)" reference (line 94) but cross-links to existing committed `inverted-negative-assertion-enshrined-...-2026-05-14.md` which already extensively documents PR #12 + commit `a4534f9`. PR is publicly closed/fixed, not an open vulnerability window. Matches existing project posture; no NEW fix-window disclosure.

42/42 ✓.

Plan-count correction (minor): plan said "7 source files → 6 destinations". Actual count is 8 source files → 7 destinations (the 8th was `feedback_plan-time-url-hallucination`; the 7th destination is `plan-time-url-validation-prevents-publish-404-2026-05-15.md`). All 7 destinations created and pass all gates; 7 smoke tests rather than 6.

## Outer-Docs Audit Result (Unit 3, executed 2026-05-15)

| Outer file | Final verdict | Action taken |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/MEDIUM_OAUTH_SETUP.md` | MOVE | mv → `backlink-publisher/docs/MEDIUM_OAUTH_SETUP.md` |
| `docs/plans/2026-05-12-001-feat-draft-queue-scheduled-publish-plan.md` | MOVE | mv → `backlink-publisher/docs/plans/2026-05-12-001-...` (slot empty inside) |
| `docs/plans/2026-05-13-001-feat-anchor-profile-scheduler-plan.md` | DELETE | Outer file had `status: superseded` + `superseded_by:` pointing to outer-002 same-day. Predecessor with no preserved value beyond what outer-002 (now inner-005) carries. |
| `docs/plans/2026-05-13-002-feat-zh-short-article-scheduler-plan.md` | MOVE-with-renumber | mv → `backlink-publisher/docs/plans/2026-05-13-005-feat-zh-short-article-scheduler-plan.md` (inner 001-004 taken on 2026-05-13). `supersedes:` field annotated. |
| `docs/brainstorms/2026-05-13-anchor-profile-scheduler-requirements.md` | MOVE | Was origin doc for both outer plans. mv → inner brainstorms. |
| `docs/brainstorms/2026-05-13-work-themed-backlinks-requirements.md` | MOVE | Inner had plan but no requirements. mv → inner brainstorms. |
| `docs/ideation/2026-05-15-open-ideation.md` | MOVE | Misplaced ideation doc from this session. mv → inner ideation. |

Outer `docs/` directory removed entirely (was 7 files in 4 dirs; now `rmdir`'d). Within 30-min timebox: yes — total audit + execution under 5 minutes (no full-content diff required since outer-001 self-declared `status: superseded` via frontmatter).

## Pre-flight Result

- **R0 / Unit 1**: VALIDATED in this same Claude Code session (2026-05-15). The `compound-engineering:research:learnings-researcher` agent was dispatched 3 times during the brainstorm + plan phases against `backlink-publisher/docs/solutions/`. Each dispatch returned matched files with absolute paths — confirming the agent reaches this directory and reads frontmatter. Specific corroborating runs: (a) Phase-1 ce:plan local research search returned 5 existing entries with frontmatter field-set; (b) ce:brainstorm document-review feasibility agent enumerated all 5 sibling files with their schemas; (c) ce:plan repo-research-analyst confirmed agent path-scanning behavior. Premise validated; proceed to Unit 1.5.

- **Upstream ideation**: `docs/ideation/2026-05-15-open-ideation.md` (note: this file moves to `backlink-publisher/docs/ideation/` as part of Unit 3)
- **Sibling schema references**: 5 existing files under `backlink-publisher/docs/solutions/`
- **Source MEMORY entries** (read-only inputs for Unit 2): 7 source files (which collapse to 6 destination files per R3 — the `config-save-overwrite-pattern` and `narrow-toml-merge-bypasses-save_config` files merge into one) at `~/.claude/projects/<project-memory-slug>/memory/feedback_<slug>.md`. Slugs: `config-save-overwrite-pattern`, `narrow-toml-merge-bypasses-save_config`, `no-runtime-llm`, `standalone-page-vs-retrofit`, `test-locks-in-bug`, `floating-point-tiebreak`, `recon-level-for-always-on-signals`, `plan-time-url-hallucination`. The `<project-memory-slug>` is resolved by the implementer from their own environment.
- **Document review findings** that shaped this plan: 4 reviewers (coherence, feasibility, security-lens, adversarial) ran against the requirements doc; 8 auto-fix clusters applied; 3 user-decision findings (ADV-1 pre-flight sequencing, ADV-2 sustainability forcing function, ADV-3 read-MEMORY-direct alternative) all baked into requirements before this plan was written.
