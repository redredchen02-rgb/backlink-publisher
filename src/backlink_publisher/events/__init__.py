"""Event substrate (read-side projection of JSON state files).

Public API:
    - ``EventStore`` (U1) — write/read access to ``events.db``
    - ``flush_for`` (U4) — project a JSON source into the event store
    - ``project_run_safe`` (Plan 005 / U4) — fail-safe project-after-run
    - ``ProjectionError`` (U4) — cursor / dispatch failures
    - ``ProjectionResult`` (U4) — counters returned by ``flush_for``
    - ``KINDS`` / ``classify`` — event-kind vocabulary + status classifier
      (dependency-free; safe to import from I/O-free writers)
