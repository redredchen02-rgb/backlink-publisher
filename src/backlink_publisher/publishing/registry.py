"""Publisher ABC + table-driven dispatcher — Plan 2026-05-18-001 Unit 7,
extended by Plan 2026-05-18-009 R9 (CLI/schema decoupling).

Replaces the ``if plat == "blogger" / elif "medium"`` chain in
``adapters/__init__.py:publish()`` with a registry the dispatch logic
walks once per call. Adding a new platform means:

  1. Implement ``Publisher.publish(payload, mode, config) -> AdapterResult``
  2. Call ``register("<platform>", NewAdapterCls)``

No changes to the dispatcher, the CLI argparse layer, or
``schema.supported_platforms`` — all of those read
``registered_platforms()`` dynamically post-R9. See
``AGENTS.md → Adding a new publisher adapter`` for the contributor
walkthrough that cites ``BloggerAPIAdapter`` at each step.

Fallback semantics (preserved from the legacy chain):

- The registry stores an ordered list of adapter classes per platform.
- ``dispatch`` walks the chain in order, instantiating each adapter and
  calling ``.publish(...)``.
- ``DependencyError`` from one adapter → fall through to the next
  (the legacy "no Medium token → try browser" path).
- ``ExternalServiceError`` from any adapter → propagate up immediately
  (preserves the legacy "401 / 429 / network failure does NOT fall
  through" semantics).
- An adapter can declare itself unavailable for a given environment by
  overriding ``Publisher.available(cls, config)`` — used by
  ``MediumBraveAdapter`` to gate itself to macOS.

Adapter-declared throttle metadata (post-R9c): adapters set
``AdapterResult.post_publish_delay_seconds`` to declare a required
post-publish wait (Medium adapters set ``30``). The CLI's verify-poll
window and inter-row throttle bookkeeping key off this field rather than
matching adapter strings against a hardcoded ``_MEDIUM_ADAPTERS`` set.

This is the minimum dispatcher generalisation; per Plan D5 we do not
rewrite adapter internals, and per Plan D8 the only method on the ABC
is ``publish`` (``verify_adapter_setup`` stays a module function).
