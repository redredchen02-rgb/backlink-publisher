"""Velog editor DOM selectors — Plan 2026-05-21-001 Unit 4a.

Best-guess selectors verified against velog.io/write as of 2026-05-21
(public DOM inspection — no real publish performed). The recipe degrades
gracefully when selectors miss: any element-not-found inside
``publish_flow`` propagates as ``ExternalServiceError`` via the
dispatcher's catch-all, prompting the operator to consult
``docs/spikes/`` or open a live `real_browser_publish_smoke`-marked
test to refresh them.

Selectors are split into a leaf module (no Playwright import) so
``_velog_selectors`` can be patched in tests without dragging in browser
deps. Each constant carries an inline comment with the DOM context.
