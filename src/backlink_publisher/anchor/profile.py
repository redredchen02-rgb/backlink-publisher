"""Per-site anchor profile state — sliding window of recent link records.

The anchor profile scheduler (zh-CN short-form path) needs a persistent view
of what anchor types and texts a site has recently published, so it can steer
each new article toward the deficit type. That state lives here as one JSON
file per site under ``~/.cache/backlink-publisher/anchor-profile/``.

Sliding window: the most recent ``_MAX_ENTRIES`` link records are kept;
older entries are trimmed on every write. This is "recent" not "all-time" by
design — the scheduler should respond to current drift, not be dragged by
ancient history when proportions or pools change.

Concurrency: ``threading.Lock`` protects the read-modify-write cycle inside
one process. Cross-process safety is NOT provided (single-process operational
convention per plan scope). If multi-process becomes real, layer an
``fcntl.flock`` sidecar lockfile around the same primitives.

Failure posture: profile state is an *advisory* signal, not a system of
record. A corrupt JSON file or version drift returns an empty profile with a
warning rather than raising — the scheduler will treat the site as cold-start
and rebuild state from new writes. The alternative (raising) would block the
entire batch on a recoverable diagnostic-only file.
