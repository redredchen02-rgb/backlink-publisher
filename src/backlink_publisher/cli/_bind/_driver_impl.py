"""Playwright headed driver for ``bind-channel`` — Plan 2026-05-19-001 Unit 2.

Responsibilities (in order):

  1. Validate the storage_state target path resolves *inside* ``_config_dir()``
     (defense-in-depth against supply-chain adapters injecting paths).
  2. Launch a **headed** Chromium via Playwright (lazy-imported — the module
     itself does not need Playwright at import time, only at ``run_bind``
     time, so the webui can import this module to share ``BindResult``
     without a Playwright transitive cost).
  3. Open the recipe's ``login_url``; emit ``channel.bind.browser_ready``.
  4. Block on ``recipe.bound_predicate(page)`` until the operator finishes
     login. A Playwright timeout here surfaces as
     ``error_code="bound_predicate_timeout"``.
  5. Export Playwright's ``storage_state`` via the context — atomically:
     write to ``<target>.tmp`` then ``os.replace`` to the real path, then
     ``os.chmod`` to 0600. A failure during persist is reported as
     ``error_code="persist_io_error"`` and ``mark_bound`` is **not** called.
  6. Call ``mark_bound(channel, target)`` and emit
     ``channel.bind.persisted``.

The CLI in ``bind_channel.py`` is responsible for emitting
``channel.bind.start`` (before validation) and the terminal
``channel.bind.failed`` event (mapping our ``BindResult.error_code``).
