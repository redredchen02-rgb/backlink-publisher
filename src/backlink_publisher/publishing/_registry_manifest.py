"""Manifest helpers — Plan 2026-05-25-002 Unit 1.

Extracted from registry.py for monolith SLOC budget. These six helpers are the
reverse-lookup API downstream layers (binding_status.py, webui_app/__init__.py
inject_platforms, webui_app/helpers/contexts.py, config/_toml_utils.py,
templates) call instead of carrying their own hardcoded channel lists.

All helpers are pure-read; thread-safe; cheap (dict.get / list-comp on ≤ 20
platforms). No caching needed at this layer — if downstream call-frequency
demands it (per [[flask-g-cache-pattern]]), the cache belongs at the caller.
