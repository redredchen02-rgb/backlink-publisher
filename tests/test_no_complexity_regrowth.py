"""Enforce per-function cyclomatic-complexity (CC) ceilings against complexity_budget.toml.

Sibling to tests/test_no_monolith_regrowth.py (which gates file SLOC). See:
    docs/plans/2026-05-29-005-feat-cyclomatic-complexity-budget-plan.md
    docs/brainstorms/2026-05-29-cyclomatic-complexity-budget-requirements.md

Enforcement model = named set + high backstop:
  (a) every function listed in complexity_budget.toml is held to its `ceiling` (no regrowth);
  (b) every function NOT listed is held to a global BACKSTOP (CC 30). Seed floor =
      BACKSTOP + 1, so there is no un-gated over-backstop gap.

Schema (R5): budget entries must have integer `ceiling` and string `rationale` >=80 chars.
CC canary: a hand-crafted fixture pins radon's CC counter so a measurement-tool bump is
caught before it silently shifts ceilings.

Adapted in structure (not policy) from test_no_monolith_regrowth.py: CC uses
radon.complexity.cc_visit() (per-function) instead of radon.raw.analyze().sloc (per-file),
keys are "<relpath>::<fullname>", and the seed convention is exact current CC (zero headroom)
rather than round_up_to_10(SLOC+30).
