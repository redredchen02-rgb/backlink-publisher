"""Medium liveness probe — Playwright-based session health check.

Extracted from webui_app/medium_liveness.py — Wave 1 thin-WebUI refactor.
Contains only probe logic (no WebUI store coupling). The orchestration
function ``medium_liveness_check`` (which calls ``webui_store``) remains
in webui_app.

Design:
  1. **Probe-copy isolation**: when an active probe runs, the live
     ``storage_state.json`` is read into memory and passed as a dict to
     ``new_context(storage_state=...)``. The probe NEVER reads the live
     file via path. This way if Cloudflare/Datadome flags the probe
     request, only the in-memory copy is compromised — the live
     credential that headed publish reads is untouched.
  2. **Conservative default**: ``MEDIUM_LIVENESS_ACTIVE_PROBE_ENABLED``
     defaults to ``False`` until anti-bot impact is confirmed.
