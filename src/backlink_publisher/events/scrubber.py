"""Free-text secret scrubber for the event substrate (T1).

Independent of ``backlink_publisher.logger._SENSITIVE_KEYS`` — that path does
exact-key matching on structured ``extra`` dicts; this path scans arbitrary
free-text (error messages, response bodies) for embedded secrets via regex
plus a high-entropy detector. The two layers are complementary, not
overlapping.

Threshold for the high-entropy detector is documented as "deferred to
implementation" in the plan (target false-positive rate ≤ 5%); 4.5
per-character Shannon over tokens of length ≥ 32 is the starting value.
