"""Salted persona identifier for the event substrate (T4).

The event log records *who* published *what* without leaking PII. The
strategy: hash ``(provider, account_label)`` with a per-installation salt
to a 16-char hex digest. The salt lives at
``~/.config/backlink-publisher/persona.salt`` (32 random bytes, mode 0600)
and is created lazily on first use.

The salt is **independent** of ``events.db`` — deleting the database to
trigger a rebuild must not regenerate the salt (otherwise every persona_id
in re-emitted events would drift, breaking historical correlation).
