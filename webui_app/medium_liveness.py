"""Plan 2026-05-19-003 Unit 5 — Medium liveness probe.

Invoked from the webui Settings GET handler (via ``_get_medium_status``
in helpers.py) to keep ``channel_status_store["medium"]`` reflecting
reality without depending on the operator triggering a publish or
re-bind to find out.

Design:
  1. **TTL cache**: skip active probe when ``last_verified_at < 5 min``
     ago. Without this cap, every Settings page load would fire a
     headless ``goto('/me')``, training Medium's anti-bot to flag the
     IP.
  2. **Probe-copy isolation**: when an active probe runs, the live
     ``storage_state.json`` is read into memory and passed as a dict to
     ``new_context(storage_state=...)``. The probe NEVER reads the live
     file via path. This way if Cloudflare/Datadome flags the probe
     request, only the in-memory copy is compromised — the live
     credential that headed publish reads is untouched.
  3. **ThreadPoolExecutor 10s budget**: Playwright sync calls block;
     we cap total time-to-verdict and return ``NEEDS_RECHECK`` if the
     probe doesn't finish, so Flask renders without waiting forever.
  4. **Conservative default**: ``MEDIUM_LIVENESS_ACTIVE_PROBE_ENABLED``
     defaults to ``False`` until Spike 2 confirms headless ``goto('/me')``
     doesn't reliably trigger anti-bot. When disabled, the probe
     short-circuits to ``NEEDS_RECHECK`` after the cache check.

Outcomes:
  - ``NEVER_BOUND`` — storage_state.json absent → re-bind needed
  - ``EXPIRED`` — store says expired (e.g., publish-time mark_expired)
  - ``CACHED_BOUND`` — within 5-min TTL of last_verified_at
  - ``LOGGED_IN`` — active probe landed on ``/@<user>`` or ``/me/*``
  - ``NEEDS_RECHECK`` — probe disabled, timed out, OR landed on a
    challenge page; live state not mutated (don't claim false-expired
    on Cloudflare hiccup)
