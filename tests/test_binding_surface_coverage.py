"""Registry-driven binding surface coverage guard (Plan 2026-05-26-002 Unit 7).

Drift sentinel: every registered platform must have a declared auth_type, and
every auth_type entry must correspond to a registered platform. Adding a new
platform to the adapter registry without a matching auth_type entry (or vice
versa) fails loudly here.

Bespoke-flow channels (blogger/velog/medium/mastodon) have auth_types that
map to custom binding UI; they are NOT flagged as missing — they appear in
_AUTH_TYPE_BY_PLATFORM and are handled by their own partials.
