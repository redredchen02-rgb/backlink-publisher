"""R8c (minimal): content gate pinning the STATUS_MAP classification.

This is a HAND-AUTHORED, independent expected table — deliberately NOT derived
from the reducer code it guards, so it can detect a wrong mapping (the
dofollow-canary lesson: a gate that proves "maps to *something*" is blind to
"maps to the *right* thing"). Flipping e.g. ("checkpoint","done") to unverified,
or turning an intentional NO_EMIT into quarantine, fails here.

The full R8a literal-ban lint + R8b bidirectional reader check land in the
follow-up PR; this gate locks the Seam-B content that the anti-P0 core depends on.
