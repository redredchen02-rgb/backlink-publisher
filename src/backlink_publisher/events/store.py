"""SQLite-backed event store for the read-side projection (events.db).

EventStore is a sibling of JsonStore (not a subclass): JsonStore's
contract is dict/list-shaped JSON files; events.db is schema-bound. The
projector (U4) translates JsonStore writes into EventStore appends.

Connection options (plan §U1 Approach):
- ``journal_mode = WAL`` — concurrent readers + single writer; the file
  layout adds ``events.db-wal`` and ``events.db-shm`` side files.
- ``synchronous = NORMAL`` — durability tradeoff acceptable for a
  rebuildable read-side projection (events.db is recoverable from JSON
  via ``bp-events-rebuild``).
- ``busy_timeout = 5000`` — 5s wait for a write lock before raising; the
  retry layer below adds another bounded backoff on transient errors.
- ``foreign_keys = ON`` — defensive even though v1 has no FK constraints.

File mode 0600, parent dir 0700; macOS Time Machine exclusion via xattr
attempted on first create (failure WARNs, never raises — U10 expands
coverage to ``.db-wal``/``.db-shm``/``persona.salt`` etc).
