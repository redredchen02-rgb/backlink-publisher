"""Cell-assignment config parser — Blast-radius Phase 1 (R7-minimal).

Parses ``[cells."<main_domain>"]`` blocks into a mapping of
``main_domain → list[channel_name]``.  Example config fragment::

    [cells."https://example.com"]
    channels = ["telegraph", "rentry"]

    [cells."https://another-site.org"]
    channels = ["blogger", "medium"]

**Fail-loud contract** (mirrors ``config/parsers/alarm.py`` — NOT the
tolerant skip-with-warning posture of ``target.py``):

- Unknown channel name (not in ``registered_platforms()``) →
  ``InputValidationError`` at parse time.  A typo (``"telegrph"``)
  would otherwise silently drop a channel the operator believes is
  enrolled — a footgun in a safety feature.
- The same channel in two or more sites' cells →
  ``InputValidationError`` at parse time.  Disjointness is the point
  of containment; overlap defeats it, and the error fires at config-load
  time (before any publishing), so the operator sees a hard failure
  before a batch starts.

``[cells.*]`` is an **unmanaged root** — deliberately NOT added to
``_SAVE_CONFIG_KNOWN_ROOTS``, so ``_preserve_unknown_sections``
passes the section through verbatim on every ``save_config`` call.
