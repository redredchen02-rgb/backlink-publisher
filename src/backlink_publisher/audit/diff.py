"""Divergence detection for the dual-state auditor (R1 + R3).

Compares the two read-only views from ``readers`` and emits one
``DivergenceRecord`` per finding. v1 classes:

- ``null_url_orphan`` (R1) — an ``articles`` row with no ``live_url``.
- ``history_orphan`` (R3) — a *published* history record none of whose published
  URLs appears in ``articles`` (the publish is entirely unrepresented).
- ``article_orphan`` (R3) — an ``articles`` row whose ``live_url`` matches no
  published URL in history.

The R3 join is on **canonical URL** (``canonicalize_url`` on both sides), never
on ``host`` (``articles.host`` is a bare netloc that ``is_same_host`` rejects,
and mixes publish-vs-target host across row types). The history-orphan rule is
**record-level** (a record is an orphan only if *none* of its URLs match), which
makes it fan-out-safe, ignores a record's draft URL when its published URL
matched, and naturally avoids re-detecting the deferred-R2 duplicate-URL case
(two records sharing one article both "match" it, so neither is an orphan).
