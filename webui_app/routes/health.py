"""/ce:health — publishing health dashboard (read-only).

Plan 2026-05-25-006 / U3. On load, runs the single-flight project-on-read
backstop (U1) so WebUI-sourced and crash-stranded outcomes are reflected, then
the read-only aggregations (U2), and renders them with honest empty / freshness
/ gap states. GET-only → the CSRF guard (mutating verbs only) does not apply.
