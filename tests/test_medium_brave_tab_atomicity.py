"""Regression tests for medium_brave tab helpers.

Before this change, `_get_tab_url`, `_focus_tab`, `_tab_js` first
resolved (win_id, tab_id) to positional (win_idx, tab_idx) in one
AppleScript call, then issued a *second* AppleScript using those
positions. Any tab opening/closing between the two calls shifted indices
and raised errAEIllegalIndex (-1719). The current implementation
resolves and acts inside a single `tell` block, so Brave evaluates
against one consistent snapshot.

These tests pin the single-call contract and the tab-gone sentinel
translation so the race-prone two-call pattern can't regress in.
