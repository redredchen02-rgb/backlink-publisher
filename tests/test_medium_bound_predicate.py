"""Regression tests for ``_medium_bound_predicate`` timeout semantics.

Lock the invariant the module docstring promises: when the ``framenavigated``
listener never fires (Spike 7 verdict — cross-origin SSO can orphan the
listener silently), the absolute wall-clock timeout — *not* the 90s idle
timeout — is the only floor. Operators must keep their full SSO+2FA
budget even when nav events go missing entirely.

Prior to the fix, ``last_nav_at`` was initialized to ``started_at`` and
the idle check fired ``_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` after the predicate began,
long before the 20-minute absolute floor was reached. The fix gates idle
enforcement on ``last_nav_at is not None`` (i.e., at least one observed
nav event).
