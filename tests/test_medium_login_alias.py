"""Tests for cli.medium_login alias — Plan 2026-05-19-005 Unit 1.

Locks the contract:
- ``medium_login.main(args)`` is a transparent alias for
  ``bind_channel.main(["--channel", "medium", *args])``.
- An informational banner is printed to stderr so plan-005 readers who
  invoke ``medium-login`` know the redirect happened.
- Extra flags pass through verbatim.
- Passing an explicit ``--channel`` flag is rejected with UsageError
  (exit_code=1) — alias implies channel, no override path.
- ``--help`` shows the bind-channel help with the alias banner.

Mirrors test_velog_login_alias.py one-for-one; the only deltas are
the channel name and the banner string.
