"""URL validation and manipulation utilities for the work-themed backlinks path.

Shared by WebUI form validators, config TOML parsers, and the work_scraper.
Stdlib-only — no third-party deps. See Plan 2026-05-13-004 Unit 1.

Conventions:
- All validators return ``str | None``: normalized URL on success, ``None`` on
  failure. Callers attach domain-specific error messages.
- Normalization preserves scheme + host case as parsed; ``is_same_host`` does
  the case-insensitive comparison locally to keep validators idempotent.
