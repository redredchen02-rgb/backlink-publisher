"""Projection from JSON state files into the read-side event store.

The projector reads checkpoint / publish-history / draft-queue JSON files,
diffs them against the per-source cursor in ``projection_cursor``, and
emits ``events`` + ``articles`` rows for the new state. Each reducer runs
inside a single ``EventStore.connect()`` transaction so a partial flush
can't half-update the database.

Idempotency is layered (plan §U4):

1. In-transaction ``seen_in_tx`` set keyed per kind catches duplicate
   logical changes emitted within one flush.
2. ``projection_cursor.last_seen_state_json`` diff keeps a no-op flush
   from inserting any rows.
3. ``articles.live_url`` UNIQUE rejects cross-source duplicates at the
   DB layer — caller catches ``IntegrityError`` and skips the matching
   ``publish.confirmed``.
