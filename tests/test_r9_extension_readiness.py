"""R9 falsifiable acceptance proof (plan 2026-05-18-009 Unit 1 / R9a+b+e).

The contract R9 promises: registering a new ``Publisher`` subclass with one
``register("x", XAdapter)`` call makes ``x`` reachable through *both* the CLI
argparse layer AND the schema-layer validation, without any other CLI or
schema edit.

This test is the falsifiable proof. If R9 silently regresses to hardcoded
platform names anywhere on the path, the FakeAdapter fixture stops working
and these tests fail.
