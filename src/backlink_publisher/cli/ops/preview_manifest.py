"""Preview manifest (Unit 3): a read-only, pre-dispatch verdict pass.

For each planned row, compute its dedup key, read the dedup store, and emit a
verdict:

* ``NEW``            — no record (or ``failed``, re-publishable) → would dispatch.
* ``SKIP-DUPLICATE`` — ``done`` → already published (carries the recorded live_url).
* ``HOLD-UNCERTAIN`` — ``uncertain``/``attempting`` → held; needs adjudication.

**Leak boundary:** stdout carries JSONL data including the canonical ``target_url``
and recorded ``live_url`` (campaign URLs — data goes to stdout by contract). The
human summary on **stderr** carries only counts plus a per-row **keyed HMAC digest**
(:meth:`DedupStore.key_digest`) — never a raw URL. A bare hash over the operator's
small, enumerable URL space would be reversible, so the digest is HMAC-keyed by a
per-store secret.

The manifest is a **carrier**, not an authority: U7's enforce gate honors the
``force`` slot but re-checks live store state at dispatch (the store can change
between preview and run). No network call — store-only reads.

Plan: docs/plans/2026-05-27-005-feat-cross-run-publish-idempotency-plan.md (U3).
