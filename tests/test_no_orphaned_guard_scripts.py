"""R5: forbid orphaned guard scripts.

A quality guard must be enforced by a CI surface, not left as an inert
``scripts/check_*.py`` that nothing runs (which gives every parallel agent false
confidence). This test asserts that every ``scripts/check_*.py`` is referenced by at
least one CI surface reachable from the repo root: a GitHub Actions workflow, a git
hook installer, or pre-commit config. It fails — naming the offender — the moment a
future change adds an unreferenced guard script.

There is no ``Makefile`` inside this package's tree; the only Makefile lives at the
workspace root, outside ``REPO_ROOT``, and is not a CI surface for this purpose.

Companion of ``test_no_monolith_regrowth.py``: both turn a repo invariant into a
CI-executed gate rather than a prose convention.
